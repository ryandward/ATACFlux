    "description": "Literature standard reduction potentials (E°') for redox couples that eQuilibrator cannot calculate from group contribution methods. These are primarily metalloproteins (cytochromes) and quinones where the redox potential depends on the protein environment, not just chemical structure.",
    "problem": "eQuilibrator uses group contribution methods that require atom-level structure (InChI). Cytochromes and other metalloproteins have no InChI because their properties depend on the protein fold and metal coordination, not the chemical formula alone. This results in ΔGf' = None and uncertainty = 100,000 kJ/mol.",
    "solution": "Use eQuilibrator's RedoxCarrier class to inject literature reduction potentials. RedoxCarrier wraps a compound with a specified potential, and its get_stored_standard_dgf_prime() method returns -F×E (using n=1 internally).",
    "n_electrons_handling": "IMPORTANT: RedoxCarrier always uses n=1. For multi-electron carriers (e.g., ubiquinone with n=2), the potential_mV field must be n × E°'. For ubiquinone: literature E°' = 45 mV, but we store 90 mV (2×45) so that -F×90mV = -8.7 kJ/mol = -nFE°'.",
    "convention": "Potentials are given for the reduction half-reaction: Ox + ne⁻ → Red. The oxidized form is assigned E°' = 0 mV (reference), and the reduced form is assigned the effective potential (n × literature E°'). This ensures ΔGf'(red) - ΔGf'(ox) = -nFE°'.",
    "validation": "Tested with r_0438 (Complex IV): Using cytochrome c E°' = 254 mV gives ΔG°' = -55.1 ± 0.8 kJ/mol. Manual calculation: (+24.5 from cyt c oxidation) + (-78.6 from O₂ reduction) = -54.1 kJ/mol. Agreement within 1 kJ/mol.",
